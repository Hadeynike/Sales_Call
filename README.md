# 🕵️‍♀️ Classifying Sales Calls ☎️

💸 Predicting the Outcome of Demo Call for a SaaS Companys. 📱

In this project I Implemented a gradient boosted tree 🌲 model (XGBoost) to classify qualification of sale demo call in order to improve forecasting efforts. This was the first time machine learning (or data science) techniques had been used in the company on something other than the product. 

I achieved ~80% accuracy & demonstrated the value of implementing machine learning to solve low-hanging fruit problem on the business side. This demonstration lead to the BI team committing to leveraging machine learning and data science for future initiative. 🎉💪🏻
