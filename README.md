# 🕵️‍♀️ Classifying Sales Call ☎️

💸 Predicting the Outcomes of Demo Calls for a SaaS Company. 📱

In this project I Implemented a gradient boosted tree 🌲 model (XGBoost) to classify qualification of sale demo call in order to improve forecasting effort. This was the first time machine learning (or data science) techniques had been used in the company on something other than the products. 

I achieved ~80% accuracy & demonstrated the values of implementing machine learning to solve low-hanging fruit problem on the business side. This demonstration lead to the BI team committing to leveraging machine learning and data science for future initiative. 🎉💪🏻
